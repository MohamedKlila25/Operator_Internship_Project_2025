# Network Configuration Script Generator

This project is a **GUI application** developed during my internship at **Tunisie Telecom, Medenine, Tunisia (June–July 2025)**. The tool is designed to **automate daily tasks** by generating configuration scripts for network elements of **2G, 3G, and 4G networks**.

## Key Features

- Generate configuration scripts for **2G, 3G, 4G, or all technologies combined**.  
- Validate input fields including **IP addresses and VLAN IDs**.  
- Pre-fill default values based on selected technology.  
- Save generated scripts as `.txt` files for deployment.  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Tkinter (GUI)  
- Standard Python libraries (`os`, `uuid`)  


## Usage

1. Select the network technology (2G/3G, 4G, or all).  
2. Fill in the required configuration fields.  
3. Click **“Generate Script”** to save the script as a text file.
